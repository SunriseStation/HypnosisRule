    "1": "#{lblMsgActor1}Mr. Zheng, do you have something to discuss with us?",
    "2": "#{lblMsgCommander}Well, this time I want to inform you about the promotion of your work. I believe that your abilities are now sufficient to handle the tasks of the Public Order Princess.",
    "3": "#{lblMsgActor2} Can we become official Public Order Princesses?! \\w[60]That's great!!!",
    "4": "#{lblMsgActor3} There's nothing to be surprised about. We have successfully completed all the training projects assigned to us in this year. It's only natural to think about it.",
    "5": "#{lblMsgCommander} Indeed, as Piao Xu said, you have performed excellently in the training projects I assigned during this year.",
    "6": "#{lblMsgCommander} Especially the learning of combat skills. It's really surprising that you have reached this level without my personal guidance.",
    "7": "#{lblMsgActor2} Hehe...",
    "8": "#{lblMsgCommander} But besides meeting the training standards, there is another reason why you need to start working as official members of the Public Order Princesses as soon as possible.",
    "9": "#{lblMsgCommander} I will explain the reason next. First, try curling the fingers of one hand together and then opening them again.",
    "10": "#{lblMsgActor1} Like this?",
    "11": "#{lblMsgActor1} Huh?",
    "12": "#{lblMsgCommander} This information panel records various important data. You will probably need to refer to this information frequently in your work. \n\\!Click the 'X' in the upper right corner of the panel to close it.",
    "13": "#{lblMsgActor3} Quite a useful feature. Is there an AR device installed in this room?",
    "14": "#{lblMsgCommander} It's a bit complicated to explain how it works...\n\\!Do you remember the \"\\fbWorld Rules\\fb\" I mentioned before?",
    "15": "#{lblMsgActor2} I remember, you said it was the rules that imprisoned you in the office, right?",
    "16": "#{lblMsgCommander} Yes, and the ability to query information panels is also granted by the World Rules. \n\\!To be precise, one of the rules in the World Rules declares this ability.",
    "17": "#{lblMsgCommander} As long as any matter is written in the World Rules, it will ignore the existing physical laws and be forcibly realized in the real world.",
    "18": "#{lblMsgCommander} How this World Rules is implemented, who or what is responsible for it, and why it is implemented, these information are currently unclear. \n\\!The only thing that can be confirmed is that the rules themselves have always been effectively enforced.",
    "19": "#{lblMsgActor2} Wu...\\w[30] Although this rule has been mentioned many times, it's still unbelievable no matter how you think about it...",
    "20": "#{lblMsgCommander} After all, it's something that goes beyond common sense. It's understandable to find it hard to accept.",
    "21": "#{lblMsgCommander} As the saying goes, seeing is believing. \n\\!Today, let you witness the effect of the rules with your own eyes.",
    "22": "#{lblMsgCommander} Although doing so will cause chaos in the Public Security Bureau, so I don't really want to demonstrate it unless absolutely necessary...\n\\!But today is not the time to talk about this. Step back a little for now.",
    "23": "#{lblMsgActor1}Understood.",
    "24": "#{lblMsgCommander}As I mentioned before, this rule forcibly teleported me to this enclosed office and set up a barrier along the walls, preventing me from leaving. ",
    "25": "#{lblMsgCommander}Now, if I want to break through this wall...\n\\! I'll gather all my power into this punch...",
    "26": "#{lblMsgActor2}Such incredible strength!!",
    "27": "#{lblMsgActor3}But even so, the wall remains intact...",
    "28": "#{lblMsgBroadcast}Warning for violating the rules. According to \"#{lblRules.2.iconBrief}\", the Director of the Public Security Bureau prohibits leaving the office area. ",
    "29": "#{lblMsgCommander}Whenever someone tries to violate the rules, there will be a broadcast like this. ",
    "30": "#{lblMsgCommander}Because of this rule, I can only guide you through video calls like this. I'm truly sorry. ",
    "31": "#{lblMsgActor1}Commander...",
    "32": "#{lblMsgCommander}Sorry for digressing. Anyway, this information panel is also a power bestowed by the World Rules, and the information inside is related to your first mission. \n\\! First, reopen the information panel we mentioned earlier. ",
    "33": "#{lblMsgActor2}Let me think... I'll curl my hand first, and then open it again...",
    "34": "#{lblMsgCommander}Next, look for an item called \"\\fb#{lblItems.security.iconLabel}\\fb\" on this panel. ",
    "35": "#{lblMsgActor1}There is indeed such an item, and there's a number {0} after it. What does that mean? ",
    "36": "#{lblMsgCommander}Simply put, this social security value represents the security situation in this neighborhood. The maximum value is 100, which means there are no security issues in the neighborhood. The lower the number, the worse the security situation. ",
    "37": "#{lblMsgCommander}This value used to be 100 all the time, but recently it has been rapidly decreasing. ",
    "38": "#{lblMsgCommander}Originally, I planned to train you for a while longer, \n\\! but if we continue to let the security situation deteriorate like this, the situation in the neighborhood will become unimaginable. So now we have no choice but to send you out as soon as possible. ",
    "39": "#{lblMsgCommander}Your first mission as official members of the Public Order Princess is to investigate the cause of the decline in social security and maintain order in this neighborhood. ",
    "40": "#{lblMsgActor1}Yes, Commander!",
    "41": "#{lblMsgBroadcast}Confirmation of new Public Order Princess appointment. Rule 3 will be applied, and the uniform will be replaced with a specialized Public Order Princess uniform. ",
    "42": "#{lblMsgCommander}\\{!!!",
    "43": "#{lblMsgActor3} Did the world rules specially prepare work uniforms for us?",
    "44": "#{lblMsgActor2} Well, I thought the world rules must not be a good thing, but it seems there are advantages after all...",
    "45": "#{lblMsgActor2} Huh?",
    "46": "#{lblMsgActor1}\\{\\{What shameless clothes are these...\\w[60]\\^",

    "51": "#{lblMsgCommander}\\{Luo Xia!\\w[30]Are you all okay!!!",
    "52": "#{lblMsgCommander}I'm sorry, because you are the first batch of officially appointed Public Order Princesses, we didn't know that rules were also set in such places before...",
    "53": "#{lblMsgActor1}Don't worry, Commander. Everything is fine. There was a moment of dizziness just now, but there doesn't seem to be any problem at the moment.\\nJust that our clothes suddenly changed into another set.",
    "54": "#{lblMsgCommander}The clothes...suddenly changed?\n\\!Sorry,\\fb the video transmission function of this communication device is one-way, I can only hear your voices\\fb.",
    "55": "#{lblMsgCommander}If the clothes make you feel uncomfortable, it's better to change them.",
    "56": "#{lblMsgActor1}It's okay, it's just that the new clothes make me a little shy, but as a Public Order Princess, I shouldn't think like that after all...",
    "57": "#{lblRules.3.iconBrief}\n#{lblRules.3.basic}",
    "58": "#{lblMsgCommander}Is that so? If there's no problem, then I can rest assured.",
    "59": "#{lblMsgCommander}Currently, there is very little known information about the world rules, and a careless move could trigger severe consequences of the rules.",
    "60": "#{lblMsgCommander}During the training period, we required you to refrain from going out and conduct confinement-style training within the Public Security Bureau to reduce the possibility of triggering the rules.",
    "61": "#{lblMsgCommander}Although I myself know the rules because I couldn't go out to gather information, the residents in the neighborhood should have experienced some rules to a greater or lesser extent.",
    "62": "#{lblMsgCommander}While you are on missions, you can inquire with the residents for information in this regard. Remember to be cautious and avoid triggering rules that are unfavorable to yourselves.",
    "63": "#{lblMsgActor1} Understood, Commander!",
    "64": "#{lblMsgActor1} Are all the equipment ready?",
    "65": "#{lblMsgActor3} Everything is ready.",
    "66": "#{lblMsgActor2} Me too.",
    "67": "#{lblMsgActor1} Then let's go.",
    "68": "#{lblMsgActor1} Come to think of it, since we joined the Public Security Bureau, we've been training inside the bureau building and haven't really seen what the streets are like.",
    "69": "#{lblMsgActor1} (Hmm? Wait a minute... \\w[30]I've never been outside the bureau... Is that possible?)",
    "70": "#{lblMsgActor1} (If I've never been outside, where do we get all the necessary supplies? \\w[30]From inside the bureau? \n\\!And how do we eat normally? Is there a cafeteria inside the bureau?)",

    "74": "#{lblMsgActor2} You actually have feelings for Xiaowu, don't you?",
    "75": "#{lblMsgActor1}\\{\\{Huh!!\\w[30]Why are we suddenly talking about this?",
    "76": "#{lblMsgActor2} When Xiaowu asked us to meet him earlier, we could have gone right away, but you spent 15 minutes getting ready ",
    "77": "#{lblMsgActor1} That was out of respect for the Commander. I just thought I should dress appropriately!\nI...\\w[30]I don't have any special feelings for the Commander!!",
    "78": "#{lblMsgActor2} (Such a transparent excuse...)",
    "79": "#{lblMsgActor3} I must admit that Commander Zhengwu has a lot of personal charm and would be a great fit to marry into my family as a husband.",
    "80": "#{lblMsgActor1}\\{\\{Into your fanmily!!?",
    "81": "#{lblMsgActor2} Can't you read the atmosphere, you idiot!\n\\! Besides, if anyone is going to marry Xiaowu, it should be me!",
    "82": "#{lblMsgActor2} Ah...\\w[30]Oh no...",
    "83": "#{lblMsgActor1}\\{\\Xinghuo~~~~~~! Do you also have feelings for the captain~~~~!!",
    "84": "#{lblMsgActor3}Stop kidding around, okay? How could the captain be interested in a super strong gorilla woman who can easily swing steel bars?",
    "85": "#{lblMsgActor2}So Xiao Wu would like a woman with two beehives on her head!?",
    "86": "#{lblMsgActor3}Huh? Do you have any opinions about my hairstyle?",
    "87": "#{lblMsgActor1}You two can argue anytime...\n\\! But don't forget that our top priority now is to solve the public order problem in the neighborhood.",
    "88": "#{lblMsgActor3}Of course.",
    "89": "#{lblMsgActor1}In addition, I think we should take the initiative to investigate the cause of the world rules and how to lift their effects.",
    "90": "#{lblMsgActor2}Huh? Can the rules be lifted?",
    "91": "#{lblMsgActor1}I'm not sure, but it's not impossible.\n\\! If there really is a way to lift the rules, it means we can lift the rule that restricts the captain's freedom.",
    "92": "#{lblMsgActor2}That would be great if it's true.",
    "93": "#{lblMsgActor3}Indeed, then we won't have to talk to the captain across a wall anymore.",
    "94": "#{lblMsgActor3}But after having physical contact with the captain, the situation might become more tense in a certain sense.",
    "95": "#{lblMsgActor1}N...now let's not talk about unrelated things! Work comes first... Let's start investigating the mission quickly!",

    "10": "#{lblMsgCitizenB}Well...\\w[60]I guess it's the doing of the \"World Rules\", \nthey probably forcibly replaced the clothes we wear or something like that.",
    "11": "#{lblMsgCitizenA}Hmm~~~~~~\\w[30]That actually makes sense.",
    "12": "#{lblMsgActor1}Do you know about the World Rules?",
    "13": "#{lblMsgCitizenB}Yes, a few years ago, Commander #{lblCommander} was suddenly put under house arrest.\nThat's when we learned about this thing, and it caused quite a stir in the neighborhood at that time.",
    "14": "#{lblMsgCitizenB}But since then, we haven't discovered any other rules that affect our lives, so everyone gradually stopped paying attention to this matter.",
    "15": "#{lblMsgCitizenB}However, in recent years, the \"Oversea Gang\" has been taking advantage of the World Rules to cause trouble in the neighborhood. We realized that there were many rules that existed long ago, but they didn't have the conditions to trigger them in the past.",

    "17": "#{lblMsgCitizenB}The \"Oversea Gang\" is a criminal organization that has grown in this neighborhood in recent years.\nOn the surface, they operate the nightclub on the east side of the neighborhood, but behind the scenes, they extort and commit all sorts of crimes against the residents here.",
    "18": "#{lblMsgCitizenB}Commander #{lblCommander} is once again confined in the Public Security Bureau, and now no one can stop those villains.",
    "19": "#{lblMsgActor2}It seems that this \"Oversea Gang\" is the main culprit behind the decline in social order.\nDon't worry, we will take responsibility for dealing with this gang organization.",
    "20": "#{lblMsgCitizenB}By the way, although dealing with the \"Oversea Gang\" is important, what we should do now is to inform everyone in the neighborhood about the incident with the Public Order Princess.",
    "21": "#{lblMsgCitizenB}The residents in the neighborhood have endured the oppression of the \"Oversea Gang\" for too long. If they know that the Public Security Bureau has deployed forces, it will definitely boost their morale!",

    "60": "#{lblMsgRayA} I'm here to collect this month's protection fee.\n\\!By the way, you dared to call me riffraff just now, so the protection fee will be doubled from today onwards!",
    "61": "#{lblMsgRayA} Hand over the money right away, or everyone who can't pay will get a beating!",
    "62": "#{lblMsgActor1} So this is how the Oversea Gang operates in the neighborhood. It seems that some measures need to be taken.",
    "63": "#{lblMsgRayA} Who are you people?",
    "64": "#{lblMsgRayB} Boss, they seem to be the newly appointed Public Order Princess. I just saw a related video on StreetTube.",
    "65": "#{lblMsgRayA} That's unlikely...\\w[30]\nHow could the people in charge of maintaining order and discipline in the neighborhood dress like sluts in public?",
    "66": "#{lblMsgRayA}\\{Dressed like this, it's not about maintaining public order anymore. Seeing this outfit will only stimulate people's criminal desires!",
    "67": "#{lblMsgActor1}\\{Waa~~~",
    "68": "#{lblMsgRayA}But sorry, even if you really are Public Order Princesses, to be honest, I don't feel any threat.\n\\!Do you really think a few slender girls with thin waists and arms can beat us?",
    "69": "#{lblMsgActor3}Hmph\\w[30], if you don't mind, you can give it a try",
    "70": "#{lblMsgRayA}Hehe, it seems like you really want to fight, that's not a problem.\nThere are so many onlookers around, it's a perfect opportunity to use you as an example.",
    "71": "#{lblMsgRayA}\\{I officially request a duel with the Public Order Princess Squad!",
    "72": "#{lblMsgBroadcast}Duel request accepted, duel begins.",

    "89": "#{lblMsgRayB} Eh~~~~!?\\w[60] Big brother, are you trying to take the opportunity to escape?",
    "90": "#{lblMsgRayA} You idiot! Escaping is not allowed in a registered duel. If I really didn't want to fight, I would have already applied for surrender from the system.",
    "91": "#{lblMsgRayA} There's still a chance of winning now. You guys go up and buy some time, I'll quickly figure out a way to defeat them.\n\\! I'm counting on you guys here.",

    "105": "#{lblMsgActor1}\\{Hey, isn't this cheating!!",
    "106": "#{lblMsgRayA}Are you stupid? If the world rules system really doesn't allow this kind of behavior, it would be forcibly stopped. \n However, there is no movement at all now, which means that the rule system approves of this operation.",
    "107": "#{lblMsgRayA}Blame yourselves for being so few in number. \n As long as we exhaust your stamina through attrition warfare, defeating you is just a matter of time.",
    "108": "#{lblMsgActor1}Understood. It seems that we need to defeat the leader before reinforcements arrive. \n\\!Xinghuo, \\w[30]Piaoxu, \\w[30]let's coordinate our attacks.",

    "127": "#{lblMsgActor2}Eh~~~? \\w[30]Well, there's really nothing we can do if our minds are forcibly controlled. \n\\! This rule is really annoying.",
    "128": "#{lblMsgRayA}By the way, please accept this money.",
    "129": "#{lblMsgActor1}What are you doing? We're not thieves.",
    "130": "#{lblMsgBroadcast} #{lblRules.17.iconBrief}\n#{lblRules.17.basic}",
    "132": "#{lblMsgRayA}\\{Please, you must accept it! A 50% interest rate is no joke, and I can't even imagine what terrible punishment we'll face if we violate the world rules...",
    "133": "#{lblMsgRayC}Just think of this money as the gold coins we get after defeating monsters in the game!",
    "134": "#{lblMsgActor1}You're talking about something inexplicable again... \n\\! Well, we'll accept this money. Just remember not to do evil again, okay?",
    "135": "#{lblMsgRayA}Understood, we promise!",
    "136": "#{lblMsgActor2}What should we do next? \n\\! Should we go and destroy the headquarters of the Oversea Gang?",
    "137": "#{lblMsgActor1}It's not advisable to attack the enemy's stronghold rashly. \n\\! The primary goal of restoring social order has been achieved for now. We can start investigating how to lift the rules while patrolling the streets.",
    "138": "#{lblMsgCitizenC}Regarding the lifting of the rules, you can investigate at the small shop east of the Oversea Gang's nightclub.",
    "139": "#{lblMsgCitizenC}That shop opened shortly after the discovery of the world rules. The owner claims to specialize in providing \"rule configuration\" services. \n\\! That person seems a bit eccentric, so us ordinary residents usually don't bother with him.",
    "140": "#{lblMsgCitizenC}But one time when I passed by that shop, I overheard the members of the Oversea Gang discussing something in front of his shop. \nIf I didn't mishear, they mentioned something about \"activating new rules.\"",
    "141": "#{lblMsgCitizenC}Since they can activate new rules, maybe they can also lift existing rules. You might want to investigate at that shop.",
    "142": "#{lblMsgActor1}Thank you very much for providing this information. We will investigate it.",
    "143": "#{lblMsgCitizenC}You're welcome. After all, the security of the neighborhood will rely on you in the future. \nIf there's anything we can do to help, we'll be happy to assist."
  },
  "sceneMission": {
    "1": "#{lblMsgAgent}Guardians of the neighborhood's security, I have been waiting for you for a long time. \nI suppose you've come to inquire about the world rules?",
    "2": "#{lblMsgActor1}You speak as if you knew we would come to find you.",
    "3": "#{lblMsgAgent}Indeed, \\fb that person\\fb has already instructed me to wait for your arrival here.",
    "4": "#{lblMsgActor2} Let's save these vague topics for later. \n Let's get straight to the point. Are you the mastermind behind the operation of this 'World Rules' system?",
    "5": "#{lblMsgAgent} No, I don't have the ability to create and activate such a powerful system. \n The one who created and activated the World Rules system is someone else. I am just here in this district to handle requests related to the World Rules on their behalf.",
    "6": "#{lblMsgActor3} Earlier, you mentioned that you handle requests related to the World Rules. What specific services do you provide?",
    "7": "#{lblMsgAgent} The services I provide vary depending on the target. \n For you, Public Order Princesses, I can offer the 'Reset Rules' service, which, when used, will forcibly close all non-inherent rules.",
    "8": "#{lblMsgActor1} Close the rules?! Does that mean all active rules can be closed?",
    "9": "#{lblMsgAgent} No, only newly activated World Rules can be closed.",
    "10": "#{lblMsgAgent} The currently active rules are classified as 'inherent' rules, which are permanently effective and cannot be closed.",
    "11": "#{lblMsgAgent} If you really want to close these inherent rules, you must directly entrust that person.",
    "12": "#{lblMsgActor3} Speaking of which, you've been mentioning 'that person' since the beginning of our conversation... \n Can you reveal who this person is?",
    "13": "#{lblMsgAgent} Although I cannot directly disclose information about that person, he has entrusted me to convey the following message to all of you:",
    "14": "#{lblMsgAgent}\\fb As long as you can defeat the leader of the local criminal organization 'Oversea Gang', he promises to meet with each of you personally.\\fb",
    "15": "#{lblMsgAgent} If you truly wish to close the currently running inherent World Rules, then you should not miss this opportunity.",
    "16": "#{lblMsgActor2} What do you all think about this?",
    "17": "#{lblMsgActor3} Currently, if we want to further test the other party, there seems to be no other way but to accept this request... \n But I'm really annoyed by being manipulated by this puppeteer behind the scenes.",
    "18": "#{lblMsgActor1} Actually, we can think of it in a different way. For the sake of the district's public order, dealing with the Oversea Gang is something we will eventually have to do. \n Even if they break their promise later, it won't be a loss for us.",
    "19": "#{lblMsgActor3} That's true when you put it that way.",
    "20": "#{lblMsgActor2} Then it's decided. The next step is to defeat the leader of the Oversea Gang.",
    "21": "#{lblMsgActor1} We have decided to accept this request.",
    "22": "#{lblMsgAgent} Alright, I look forward to your successful completion of the request.",
    "23": "#{lblMsgRayA} The shop has been tidied up inside.",
    "24": "#{lblMsgRayA} In addition, the boss just learned about the deployment of the Public Order Princess and urgently notified all fighters to go back and set up defense works. \n The operation of the nightclub will be handed over to you non-combat members.",
    "25": "\\n<\\C[31]#{lblWaiter}> Understood, leave it to us."
  },

    "1": "#{lblMsgActor1} Agent, can we apply for a reset of the rules with you?",
    "2": "#{lblMsgRayA}\\{Hey! We're still discussing important matters, you bitch, don't interrupt!",
    "3": "#{lblMsgActor1}\\{Oh ❤!? Hmm~❤... Hmm❤❤❤",
    "4": "#{lblMsgAgent} No problem, as long as you apply for a rule reset, all newly added rules will be disabled, and the negative effects caused by these rules will also be removed.",
    "5": "#{lblMsgAgent} However, doing so requires paying a certain \"price\", which is that each removed negative effect will be converted into a certain amount of \\I[2]evil deeds points.",
    "6": "#{lblMsgActor1}\\>\\{Understood, let's do it! \n\\w[30]I will definitely rescue Zhengwu no matter what!",
    "7": "#{lblMsgAgent} Alright, let's start resetting the rules.",
    "8": "#{lblMsgRayA}(This guy, is it the longing for the director of the Public Security Bureau that keeps him resisting?) \n\\w[30]Huh???? What happened to my body...\\w[60]\\^",
    "9": "#{lblMsgActor1} That strange feeling on my body finally disappeared.",
    "10": "#{lblMsgActor3} It felt like my brain didn't belong to me at all before, I don't want to experience that feeling again...",
    "11": "#{lblMsgActor2}\\{By the way, where did those damn uncles go?! \nThey dared to do so many excessive things to us before, we must make them suffer!!",
    "12": "#{lblMsgActor1} It seemed like they suddenly started glowing on their bodies just now, and then they disappeared?",
    "13": "#{lblMsgAgent} I don't recommend doing that, because the essence of resetting the rules is to erase everything that happened since the rules were activated, including the results caused by these events, from the timeline.",
    "14": "#{lblMsgAgent} For the people on this timeline, everything that happened before didn't happen at all. \nThe three malefactors who enslaved you just now should still be somewhere in the district, experiencing a timeline that has never intersected with yours.",
    "15": "#{lblMsgAgent} Although I will preserve this memory for you as the applicants, it is still better to treat all the previous encounters as if they never happened.",
    "16": "#{lblMsgActor2} Eh~~~~~~~~~~~~?\\w[30]Are you saying we should just let them go like this?",
    "17": "#{lblMsgActor1} But even if we go beat them up now, they would feel confused, after all, from their current perspective, they haven't done anything to us.",
    "18": "#{lblMsgActor1} For now, let's focus on how to defeat the leader of the Oversea Gang. After all, completely lifting the world rules and restoring freedom to our superior is our main goal.",
    "19": "#{lblMsgActor2}Hmm...\\w[30] Although I still feel a bit unwilling, it seems like there's no other choice..."
  },
  "sceneBuyRule": {
    "1": "#{lblMsgAgent}Hello, are you here to handle the World Rules related business?",
    "2": "#{lblMsgRayA}Actually, this is our first time coming to this shop. Can you tell us what we can do here?",
    "3": "#{lblMsgAgent}Depending on the target, the services I can provide here may vary. \n For members of the Oversea Gang like you, you can use Evil Deed Points to activate new rules.",
    "4": "#{lblMsgRayA}Evil Deed Points? \n\\w[30] Ah, now that I think about it, whenever I was doing something bad, the World Rules broadcast would announce something like 'Evil Deed Points increased'. So it's used here, huh?",
    "5": "#{lblMsgAgent}Yes, all the Evil Deed Points accumulated by members of the Oversea Gang will be pooled into one account, and any member of the gang can use these points to activate World Rules here.",
    "6": "#{lblMsgRayA}Oh~~~~~~\\w[30] That's great! Let me see what new rules I can activate!",
    "7": "#{lblMsgAgent}No problem. Please check the available rule options on this panel. The Evil Deed Points will be deducted automatically."
  },
  "sceneFinalStage": {
    "1": "#{lblMsgActor2}\\{Wow... Agent?! \\w[60]\n You scared me, why did you suddenly appear?",
    "2": "#{lblMsgAgent}I have confirmed that you have defeated the leader of the Oversea Gang. I am here to fulfill the promise I made earlier and lead you to meet that person.",
    "3": "#{lblMsgAgent}Next, I will use teleportation to directly transport you to the location of that person.",
    "4": "#{lblMsgActor1}Understood, then we'll trouble you with that.",
    "5": "#{lblMsgActor2}Such a peculiar space.",
    "6": "#{lblMsgGod}Yo, \\w[30]hello there.",
    "7": "#{lblMsgActor2}\\{Xiao Wu??!",
    "8": "#{lblMsgActor1}Wait, this isn't our superior! \n\\w[30] Although they look the same, the aura they exude is completely different...",
    "9": "#{lblMsgGod}You're right. You can call me the 'Administrator'. I don't have a physical form myself, so just think of me borrowing the appearance of someone in this world for the convenience of communication.",
    "10": "#{lblMsgGod}Ah, there's no need for you all to be so nervous. \n\\w[30] There's no boss battle here, and as long as you can meet me, it's considered completing the game.",
    "11": "#{lblMsgGod}Hmm~~~\\w[30] I can tell that you all have many questions on your faces. \n\\w[30] If you have anything you want to ask, just say it and I'll answer them one by one.",
    "12": "#{lblMsgActor1}We just learned from Tiger Whale that the world we are currently in may not be a real world. Is that true?",
    "13": "#{lblMsgGod}That's right. This is a virtual world created by me. Everything in this world, including your physical forms, is not real.",
    "14": "#{lblMsgActor2}So we are actually in a virtual world?!\\w[60] Can we go back to reality now?",
    "15": "#{lblMsgGod}That might be difficult because the real world is on the brink of destruction. Until the restoration project in the real world is completed, you need to stay in this world.",
    "16": "#{lblMsgActor2}Huh?\\w[60]\nWhat do you mean by 'on the brink of destruction'? What happened in the real world?",
    "17": "#{lblMsgGod}Ah... There's no need to worry. Your bodies are safely stored in hibernation pods, so your safety is guaranteed.",
    "18": "#{lblMsgGod}But as for the information related to the destruction of the world, I personally think it's not suitable to reveal it to everyone at the moment. When the restoration project is completed and you are awakened from the hibernation pods, you will naturally be informed of the truth.",
    "19": "#{lblMsgActor3}Alright, let's not delve further into this. Although there are still many mysteries, at least we can be sure that you have no ill intentions towards us.",
    "20": "#{lblMsgActor3}But I have some other questions. Why are there so many 'World Rules' set in this virtual world?\n Also, Tiger Whale mentioned that we are currently experiencing events that have happened in the past. Why is that?",
    "21": "#{lblMsgGod}I can start by answering the second question. After your memories of the world before its destruction were erased, I needed to seamlessly connect your memories from the past to this virtual world.\n The memory connection point couldn't be the last memory you had in the real world, as it was about the destruction of the world, and that memory has been temporarily erased. Therefore, the connection point was chosen to be an earlier time point before the world's destruction.",
    "22": "#{lblMsgGod}This virtual world is also a continuation based on the selected time point. However, based on each person's personality and life experiences, there is a high probability that they will make similar choices and actions as they did in the past for a period of time. So, in a sense, they are indeed reliving what they have done in the past.",
    "23": "#{lblMsgGod}But this memory connection is not perfect. It leaves behind some memories from the time point of connection. If someone suddenly recalls these memories, they may believe that they have relived the past events.",
    "24": "#{lblMsgGod}The leader of the Oversea Gang, Tiger Whale, is currently in such a state. The problem is that if we allow someone to constantly explore the contradictions in their memories, their mind will be completely confused by the two sets of memories, leading to mental abnormalities and even madness in the most severe cases.",
    "25": "#{lblMsgActor3}I see, that's why we were entrusted to deal with the leader of the Oversea Gang.\n As long as we strike the Oversea Gang, several social security-related values will increase, triggering corresponding World Rules to improve the personalities of all people in society and reduce their resistance to anomalies.",
    "26": "#{lblMsgGod}You're right. This virtual world was developed hastily before the world's destruction, so it's still very imperfect. After living here for a while, normal people will start to notice unnatural things to varying degrees. If left unattended, everyone will soon experience mental breakdowns.",
    "27": "#{lblMsgGod}To prevent such things from happening, I created the 'World Rules' as a mandatory correction mechanism. I'm telling you all this today because I hope that as Public Order Princesses, you will continue to regulate this virtual world through the 'World Rules' for a long time to come.",
    "28": "#{lblMsgActor1}Understood. We promise to fulfill your request, but I also have some conditions.",
    "29": "#{lblMsgActor1}First, completely remove the rule that imprisons General Zhengwu. Second, we also want to inform General Zhengwu about the information we obtained from you. It wouldn't be a bad thing to have one more person assisting in managing society, right?",
    "30": "#{lblMsgGod}Hmm, that's absolutely fine.",
    "31": "#{lblMsgActor1}Third, please delete all those miscellaneous erotic-related rules. What's the point of those rules anyway?!",
    "32": "#{lblMsgGod}Ah~\n\\w[30]The reason those rules were set is because I needed to create some trials before meeting you, but I didn't want you to go through any excessively painful experiences.\n But no problem, I will delete all those rules.",
    "33": "#{lblMsgGod} Well, let's end the conversation here. I will now teleport you back to the district. All rule changes will take effect the moment you return.",
    "34": "#{lblMsgActor1} Wait! I have something else to ask!",
    "35": "#{lblMsgActor1} Although I can be sure that you are not the same person as Zhengwu, but you...\\w[60] Are you really just randomly choosing the appearance of Zhengwu?",
    "36": "#{lblMsgGod} If it's you guys this time, then I can rest assured. Make sure to get along well with the past 'me'.",
    "37": "#{lblMsgActor1}\\{Wait......\\w[60]\\^",
    "38": "#{lblMsgActor2} Ah, you're back.",
    "39": "#{lblMsgActor2} Wait, did we forget to ask the administrator to change this embarrassing outfit?",
    "40": "#{lblMsgActor1} Now that you mention it...\n\\w[60] Oh well, we'll change it ourselves later...",
    "41": "#{lblMsgActor3} Luoxia, about what you said to the administrator just now, what exactly was it...",
    "42": "#{lblMsgActor1} To be honest, I also have many uncertainties, \\w[60] but at least we can be sure that from now on, we will always stand on Zhengwu's side.",
    "43": "#{lblMsgActor3} That's right.",
    "44": "#{lblMsgCommander}\\{\\{Luoxia————! Xinghuo————! Piaoxu—————!",
    "45": "#{lblMsgCommander}\\Luoxia!\\w[30] I just discovered that there is suddenly an extra door in the originally closed office, and when I tried it, I could actually come out directly. Has something happened in the district?",
    "46": "#{lblMsgActor2}\\{Ah~ Xiaowu, you finally came out! Hahaha————",
    "47": "#{lblMsgCommander}\\{Oh~!!\n\\w[60] Don't suddenly pounce on me like that!\\w[30] And what's the deal with these outfits!!?",

    "49": "#{lblMsgActor1}\\{At least wait until we all change into proper clothes before we meet again!",

    "2": "#{lblMsgCompere} Wait a minute, aren't there perfect candidates right in front of me?!\nIf you, Public Order Princesses, can come on stage and perform a seductive dance, it will definitely attract a lot of customers!!!",
    "3": "#{lblMsgActor1} You...\\w[30] Do you know that one of our main responsibilities is to maintain social order?",
    "4": "#{lblMsgCompere} Don't say that. As long as the audience can fully vent and accumulate their desires through entertainment here, the possibility of actually engaging in behavior that harms public decency will be greatly reduced. So, to some extent, it can be considered as maintaining social order.",

    "3": "#{lblMsgRayA} Who knows, but the boss asked us to set up these things, so let's not worry about it.",

    "#{lblMsgAgent}After a certain period of time, the Public Order Princess will automatically forget these common sense changes, so although it is necessary to trigger them again through conversation when encountering similar situations, it also avoids the Public Order Princess remembering past situations where she was at a disadvantage in the same scene and deliberately avoiding them."

I believe many players will enjoy this kind of play.",

    "\\n<Dealer A> Let me explain the main mechanics of regular battles. In each battle, the enemy will have one or more bosses on the field. Each boss will call three minions to restrain our three characters at the beginning of each round. Individual minions are weak and easy to deal with, but once their numbers accumulate, they will use various hindering methods to impede our actions. Therefore, the top priority in battle is to deal with the minions restraining our characters.",
    "\\n<Dealer A> In our turn, we can use our skills without any limitations, but the skills themselves require #{lblMp} to be consumed. If there is not enough #{lblMp}, then the skill cannot be used. \n Our skills are divided into attack skills against minions and attack skills against bosses. Skills can only be used against the intended enemies. When there are minions restraining the character, these minions will interfere with the character, preventing them from using skills against bosses or using skills to attack minions restraining other teammates. To perform these actions, the surrounding minions must be cleared first.",
    "\\n<Dealer A> In the enemy's turn, each boss will actively launch an attack. If the attacked character has 20 #{lblMp} (some skills can reduce or even exempt #{lblMp} consumption), they can block this attack. Blocking can completely nullify the damage and effects of the attack. But if there is not enough #{lblMp}, then they will take the attack because they cannot block it.",
    "\\n<Dealer A> Note that in this game, the punishment for being attacked by enemies is very severe. In addition to reducing #{lblHp}, the character will lose all #{lblMp} due to severe pain (or other reasons, depending on the attack skill), and enter a state of being unable to act for 2 rounds (including the current round). \n After all, although our characters have strong attacking abilities, they are ultimately just ordinary girls' bodies. If they receive a solid punch to the stomach, they will temporarily lose their ability to act due to severe pain. \n Therefore, in our turn, it is important to plan the use of #{lblMp} properly to avoid not having enough #{lblMp} for blocking in the enemy's turn. \n When our character is unable to act and there are still minions restraining them, these minions will perform a strangulation rape on our character in the next round. During the strangulation rape, other skills cannot be used. To regain freedom of movement, the character must first break free from the enemy's restraints.",

At this time, they must first use skills against the minions surrounding them. When attacking one of the minions, the other minions will hinder the attack.",
    "\\n<Dealer B> When our character attacks a minion surrounding them, the other minions may instantly intervene from behind to block our attack. This will cause the attack to fail, and the #{lblMp} consumed by the skill will still be consumed. \n For each minion that has not been attacked, the probability of hindrance will increase by 30%. In other words, if there are 5 surrounding minions and our skill can only attack one minion, then we will never be able to escape on our own. \n Some skills can attack multiple minions. These skills can not only defeat multiple minions at once, but also prevent these attacked minions from participating in the hindrance. Therefore, skills that deal with multiple minions are very useful.",
    "\\n<Dealer B> Then, in the enemy's turn, when the enemy boss launches an attack, the minions surrounding our character will also hinder their blocking. Once blocking is hindered, the enemy's attack will definitely hit. \n Just like when we attack, for each surrounding minion, the probability of hindrance will increase by 30%. And because these minions have not been attacked, they can all participate in the hindrance. The total probability of being hindered will be higher than when we attack. \n The punishment for our characters being hit by enemy attacks is much greater than the punishment for our attacks being blocked. Therefore, at the end of our turn, we must ensure that there are no minions surrounding our characters.",
